# Global Climate Classification Changes

---

Author: Rick Forest  

## Description  

This project analyzes global climate classification changes by comparing climate data from a recent Decadal Climate Period (2015–2024) with the WMO Climatological Reference Period (1961–1990).  

The analysis will be done by applying the Köppen-Trewartha climate classification system to downloaded ERA5 climate data, identifying and visualizing the climate classification changes.

## Key Findings  

9.6% of the Earth’s land surface has changed climate classification.  
2.6% of the Earth’s land surface has changed to a dry classification.  
3.0% of the Earth’s land surface has changed from cold (polar and boreal) to temperate.

## Process Steps

1. Data Acquisition - download and save ERA5 climate reanalysis gridded data.
2. Data Aggregation - aggregate multi-year monthly data into climatological averages.
3. Determinant Calculation - calculate climate classification determinants
4. Climate Classification - apply the Köppen–Trewartha classification system
5. Change Identification - identify the shifts in classification between the two periods
6. Change Visualization - visualize the key changes (increased dry and decreased cold areas)
